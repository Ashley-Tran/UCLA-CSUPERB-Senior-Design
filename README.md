## Getting Started

### Set up from the CLI 

1. ```cd``` into the 'example' directory

2. run ```firebase login```
   
3. Once you've logged in, run ```dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli```, then ```flutterfire configure```
   
    i. Select the appropriate project
ii. Choose which platforms you'd like to be supported (iOS & Android)

4. Make sure Flutter's installed: ```flutter doctor``` 

5. run ```flutter pub get```
   i. (opt.) run ```flutter pub outdated``` to see dependencies that could be upgraded
   ii. run ```flutter pub upgrade <pkgName>``` to update a specific dependency
       a. OR run ```flutter pub upgrade --major versions``` (may cause version errors)
   
6. Make sure to have a simulator available
    i. run ```flutter devices``` to see what emulators are available
   ii. (iOS) run ```open -a simulator``` (there's probably an Android equivalent, but I don't know it)
